The most insane Applied Energistics 2 addon for Minecraft 1.20.1 (Forge), and 1.21.1 (NeoForged) ((Soon)).
Adds features nobody thought AE2 could ever have.

---

## Features

* Mob Storage Cells – store thousands of living entities in your ME Network. Works with Pattern Providers & digital mob farms.
* The BIGGEST Pattern Provider – scale up to thousands of patterns, supports upgrades, keeps patterns when moved.
* Automatic Builder – replicate entire structures or use programmable scripts.
* Entity Ticker – supercharge your machines (at the cost of massive power drain).
* Auto Enchanter – turn liquid XP into guaranteed enchantments (works with Apotheosis).
* GregTech circuit integration – change programmed circuit numbers directly inside AE2.
* Custom Displays – markdown text, colors, multi-block tiling, resource counters, interactive signs.
* Super Singularities – so dense they damage players on contact.
* Nokia 3310 – rotate, flip, copy & paste builds.
* Advanced Crafting CPUs – naming, priority, cancel-all button, NBT-agnostic patterns.

And much more: tag view cells, NBT-aware Storage Bus, redstone integration, built-in calculator, hologram previews for multiblocks.

## Documentation

Everything is explained in-game:

* Integrated into the AE2 Guide.
* Recipes visible in JEI/EMI.
* Multiblock controllers include real-time hologram previews.

No external wiki required.
